- My career as a UX Writer stands out due to an unusual background: a degree in Hispanic Literature and a Web Development Bootcamp. 📚💻

- I realized that my love for literature and technical experience could uniquely converge in the field of UX Design. 🎨

- My training has provided me with a unique perspective on how language can influence user interaction and experience. 👩🏻‍💻

- My meticulous approach and ability to understand user needs complement my skill in translating complex concepts into clear and accessible messages. 📝

- I am excited to continue growing in the field of UX Design, exploring new ways to enhance the interaction between users and technology. 💡

## 🚀 Projects

- [🔗 Markdown Links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md-links-lgr):

    I developed a command-line tool (CLI) as well as a JavaScript library that allows the user to read and analyze a Markdown-format file to check the validity of the links it contains and report some statistics, using Node.js for this purpose.

- [🍎 Social Network: VeganBook](https://dev-008-social-network-veganbook.vercel.app/):

    Through collaborative Git, as a team, we created a responsive social network in the form of a Single Page Application (SPA) called VeganBook, which allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage posts. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Firebase and Firestore for data storage.

- [🎥 Data Lovers: Ghiblipedia](https://lesliegaribay.github.io/DEV008-data-lovers/):

    Through collaborative Git, a colleague and I built a responsive web page that allows users to view, filter, and sort datasets about Studio Ghibli movies. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- [💳 Card Validation](https://lesliegaribay.github.io/DEV008-card-validation/):

    I developed a web application that allows a user to validate a credit card number and also hides all digits except the last four, using the Luhn algorithm.

## 🔍 Currently Exploring

I'm currently creating a system for a restaurant, where employees can take customer orders using a tablet and send them to the kitchen for efficient and organized food preparation. To achieve this, I'm using JavaScript and React.
